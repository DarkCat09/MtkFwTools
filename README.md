# MTK Firmware Tools Project
## MFT Scripts
MediaTek Firmware Tools proposes its simple scripting language.

Scripts can be use for porting firmwares (in a main program of this project - [MtkFwTools](#mtkfwtools)),<br />
or to [automate routine file operations](#mft-runtime).

Read the wiki for how to create your own MFT-script.

## MtkFwTools
MediaTek Firmware Tools is a powerful toolbox with a big functional:
 - Automated firmware porting using MFT-scripts
 - Automated firmware "bugfix"
 - Installing Root, GApps, etc. on your device
 - Reading LogCat
 - Other ADB-tools
 - Russian language (sorry for my bad English)
 
 MFT is written in Java!

## MFT Runtime
A standalone JAR for executing MtkFwTools-scripts without any firmware operations (like unpacking `boot.img`).
You can use it to avoid manual routine file operations.
